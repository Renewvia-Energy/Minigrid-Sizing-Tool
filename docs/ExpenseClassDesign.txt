-- Summary Sheet --
The goal is to generate the original budget table in Summary sheet.
This table is a presentation of the Expense List sheet

1. Original Budget table is generated from the Budget Total column
2. Running Budget is calculated from Running Budget Total column

-- Expense List --

Assume that the list of expenses is given includes category, type of item
For anything that is classified as yes in auto-budgeted column, we can simply look it up in the quick inputs 

1. For any items that are auto-budgeted, we can look up the price in data that we gound in quick-inputs
 -> Data from quick inputs will be process into JSON format:
    {Category: {Type: {Item:Price}}

    For example:
    {   
        Batteries: {
            Materials: {
                Battery Cost: 22000, 
                Number of Batter: 10},
            Customs: {
                VAT:  6375975
                Inspection Fee:  20,550.00
            } 
        }
        Fencing: {
            Materials: {
                Fencing materials: 35000,
                Fencing materials transport: 350,
                Generator foundation labor: 35000,
            },
            Transport: {
                ...
            },
            Labor: {
                ...
            }
        }
    }

    2. I'm still not sure how to calculate the budget for half and no auto-budgeted items

    -- Quick Inputs Constants--

    Since the data in this sheet is constant, we can create a look up table using JSON like above once and keep it in the system

    -- Quick Inputs - Change Every Time --
    Since the data in this sheet is changed every time, we should have a function that parse information from a file (maybe excel or .txt). Could be better if it's JSON
    How we store information from this sheet will directly affect the calculation for Expense List. We create a table that has Category, Type and Item (these are the unique ket)
    matches with the Category, Type and Item in Expense List sheet
